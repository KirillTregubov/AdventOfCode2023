  <p>A set of solutions for Advent of Code 2023 written in Rust.</p>
</div>

## Preface

This is my first time participating in Advent of Code and my first look at Rust. All solutions have been tested against the puzzle inputs provided to my account on the Advent of Code website. As per the [About](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) page, the puzzle text and inputs are not included in this repository.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Inputs

The inputs for each day should be stored in an `inputs` directory in the root of the project. Each file is named after the day it corresponds to. For example, the input for day 1 is stored in `inputs/day1.txt`. The inputs can be retrieved from the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

### Running the Program

To run the program, you need to pass two arguments: the day and the part of the challenge you want solved.

```bash
Usage: cargo run <day> <part>
Example: cargo run 1 1
```
The example will run the solution for day 1, part 1.
