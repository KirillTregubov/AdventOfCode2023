  <h1>Advent of Code 2023</h1>
  <p>A set of solutions for Advent of Code 2023 written in Rust.</p>
</div>

## Preface

All solutions have been tested against the puzzle inputs provided to my account on the Advent of Code website. As per the [About](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) page, the puzzle text and inputs are not included in this repository.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Inputs

The inputs for each day should be stored in an `inputs` directory in the root of the project. Each file is named after the day it corresponds to. For example, the input for day 1 is stored in `inputs/day1.txt`. The inputs can be retrieved from the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

### Running the Program

To run the program, you need to pass two arguments: the day and the part of the challenge you want solved.

```bash
Usage: cargo run <day> <part>
Example: cargo run 1 1
```
The example will run the solution for day 1, part 1.
